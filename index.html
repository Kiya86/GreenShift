                <h2>OUR PURPOSE</h2>
                <p>Every day, our cities are gradually losing more green space, causing many negative outcomes. This includes, but is not limited to, heat waves, amplified climate risks, and choking out wildlife. GreenShift offers a clear solution as we plant native trees and living walls in order to cool cities and other locations, such as sidewalks. We mobilize volunteers to remove plastic and trash from our waterways, and we campaign all over the globe to stop deforestation before it's too late. These actions cut an average of 2,000 metric tons of CO2 per project, cooling neighborhoods by 10 degrees Fahrenheit, which causes our vital ecosystems to be restored. But we can’t do it alone. Join GreenShift today! Download our free carbon tracking app, join local tree planting events, or donate to expand our mission. Together we cause change; together let’s paint the World Green!</p>

                        <h3>Visual Rhetoric Rationale</h3>
                        <p>The visualization is meant to show how the Earth will become polluted and uninhabitable if no change is initiated. Components such as trash everywhere, dead trees, animals like the fish stuck in plastic waste, and the Earth being polluted are some of the components showing what our planet would be like if no actions are taken. Our mission at GreenShift is to have our planet Earth be habitable, healthy, and have it be painted green. The illustrations portrayed in the two of our visualizers underscore our core message here at GreenShift to have action taken immediately because it is our destiny to determine what our planet could look like from now on and in the future. So please, join us at GreenShift because together we believe that we can Paint the World Green.</p>
                        <h3>Logo Rationale</h3>
                        <p>Our logo combines ethos, pathos, and logos into a single image that is easy to recognize. The globe is meant to convey both unity and accuracy, as our work is seen all over the world and is data driven. Its bright colors, such as the bright blue ocean, are meant to suggest the power of water as it is essential to human life. This reminds everyone that every drop of clean water matters. The green continents are meant to show both growth and hope, trying to evoke emotional desires for a better and healthier world. The sign saying “Save the Earth” on top of the globe is meant to add urgency and a human touch. Furthermore, the bold font on a curved banner is meant to show the professionalism at GreenShift. Together, all of these elements establish credibility and appeal to values.</p>

                        <h3>Multimedia Rhetoric Rationale</h3>
                        <p>In our campaign video, we made several delivery choices to try and appeal to the viewer's emotions, to get them to feel/understand our mission. Starting off with the choice of scenery for the video, being surrounded by bushes and trees. In hopes that we can visually connect with the audience to the type of work we are trying to accomplish. The setting alludes to the purpose of our company, GreenShift- bringing nature back into urban life.  But also, with the help of each of the speaker's tones, it conveys passion, which, with the setting, helps create a sense of urgency and necessity. Trying to get the audience to personally connect with the cause and be inclined to join our organization. Speaking of tone, we try to maintain a formal/tone throughout one to reflect the credibility of our Organization, GreenShift. Each of the founding members, the backbone behind the scenes, introduced themselves in a clear manner that made what they said simple and quite understandable. Showing that our organization is structured and one that deserves to be trusted. In short, our style of tone aims to make the cover of the organization legitimate and highly respected. Finally, the cherry on top, we fully utilized invention in our campaign. In said campaign, we relied heavily on logic and data to set up a persuasive argument. Validating not only our cause but the reasons why we need the audience's help as well. The data itself was based on realistic statistics terminology, such as “2,000 metric tons of CO2,” to make our work measurable and effective. Painting an image of the effects of our organization. The actual work may be fabricated, but it serves its purpose to simulate the kind of work done by real environmental groups. Making our organization feel grounded in science and feasibility. Solidifying our message that GreenShift is not only an idea but a real solution to climate change.</p>

                    <h3>Slogan Rationale</h3>
                    <p>The slogan “Paint the World Green!” is meant to employ a call to the audience to take action. By framing environmental restoration as “painting,” it causes our mission to feel creative and personal. The word “green” is meant to remind people of plants, clean air, and growth, showing exactly what our mission is working towards. Our slogan is short and direct, making it memorable and powerful. Overall, our slogan is meant to remind everyone that any effort adds up to a larger change. </p>
