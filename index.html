                <h2>OUR PURPOSE</h2>
                <p>Our purpose is to reduce carbon emissions while improving urban life by integrating nature into our cities. By introducing plants into our cities, we will provide shade to combat the heat and create shelter for local wildlife. We also aim to raise awareness about deforestation as we strive to preserve ecosystems and maintain our connection with nature. Furthermore, we also work toward removing harmful waste such as trash from the oceans, forests, lakes, and other habitats. We want to protect and restore the environment we all depend on. </p>

                        <h3>Visual Rhetoric Rationale</h3>
                        <p>The visualization is meant to show how the Earth will become polluted and uninhabitable if no change is initiated. Components such as trash everywhere, dead trees, animals like the fish stuck in plastic waste, and the Earth being polluted are some of the components showing what our planet would be like if no actions are taken. Our mission at GreenShift is to have our planet Earth be habitable, healthy, and have it be painted green. The illustrations portrayed in the two of our visualizers underscore our core message here at GreenShift to have action taken immediately because it is our destiny to determine what our planet could look like from now on and in the future. So please, join us at GreenShift because together we believe that we can Paint the World Green.</p>

                        <h3>Multimedia Rhetoric Rationale</h3>
                        <p>In our campaign video, we made several delivery choices to try and appeal to the viewer's emotions, to get them to feel/understand our mission. Starting off with the choice of scenery for the video, being surrounded by bushes and trees. In hopes that we can visually connect with the audience to the type of work we are trying to accomplish. The setting alludes to the purpose of our company, GreenShift- bringing nature back into urban life.  But also, with the help of each of the speaker's tones, it conveys passion, which, with the setting, helps create a sense of urgency and necessity. Trying to get the audience to personally connect with the cause and be inclined to join our organization. Speaking of tone, we try to maintain a formal/tone throughout one to reflect the credibility of our Organization, GreenShift. Each of the founding members, the backbone behind the scenes, introduced themselves in a clear manner that made what they said simple and quite understandable. Showing that our organization is structured and one that deserves to be trusted. In short, our style of tone aims to make the cover of the organization legitimate and highly respected. Finally, the cherry on top, we fully utilized invention in our campaign. In said campaign, we relied heavily on logic and data to set up a persuasive argument. Validating not only our cause but the reasons why we need the audience's help as well. The data itself was based on realistic statistics terminology, such as “2,000 metric tons of CO2,” to make our work measurable and effective. Painting an image of the effects of our organization. The actual work may be fabricated, but it serves its purpose to simulate the kind of work done by real environmental groups. Making our organization feel grounded in science and feasibility. Solidifying our message that GreenShift is not only an idea but a real solution to climate change.</p>
